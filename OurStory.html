          <h4>We met at school</h4>
          In 2016, I was 16 years old, had just finished 
          10th gradea few days prior to the graduation 
          event that was being held on the school grounds. 
          That night was by far the best night of my life, 
          cause that's when I saw the man of my dreams waiting
          in the doorway to the hall. Already drenched in punch 
          and frantically cleaning himself off, I knew from 
          the that point he would be the one.
          <h4>We Went To Univeristy Together</h4>
          A few years pass, after we both graduated high school 
        together, we both immediately began enrolling in 
        universities we both found suitable. Fortunately for the 
        both of us we got into the same university, but two 
        completely different fields… obviously. I went into 
        Databases, and he went into Electrical Engineering.
        <h4> Date At The Lake</h4>
        Our first trip together was by far the best we’ve had. 
        It was the time we both decided to go to a log cabin near 
        a freshwater lake up in the mountains after our first year 
        of university. Things got exciting once we were out the car,
        we ran and jumped alongside the lake side all while the
        sunset between the hills in the distance began to set.
        <h4>Morning Coffee's</h4>
        Once a week between all the assignments and projects, we 
      would always take one day out of our schedules and go for 
      either morning or afternoon coffees. We used this time to 
      catch up with each other, and it made us grow more founder 
      for one another.
      <h4>Late Night Dinners</h4>
      Having dinner together was very rare in our case, because 
        we would both either be busy at the same time, or the one 
        is busy while the other wasn’t. Though when we did have the 
        opportunity to dine together, it was late into the night but
        THAT made it all the more special.
        <h4>Traveled To Germany</h4>
        For our second-year graduation celebration, we somehow made the 
        money throughout the year to go overseas. We both wanted to go 
        somewhere different, he wanted to go to the US and I wanted to go 
        to Italy, but we put our differences aside and decided to go to 
        his home town from when he was a kid which was situated in 
        Germany, Rothenburg.
        <h4> Christmas Festival on Vacation</h4>
        Luckily, we picked the most opportune moment to go to Germany. We 
        had arrived there the day before Christmas, and we saw all the 
        towns folk setting up for their annual Christmas Festival while
        walking the streets. However, it was nothing compared to what we 
        saw on the night of Christmas… all the colourful lights lit up 
        the entire centre of the town where they had set up massive 
        Christmas tree. Out of all those amazing sights nothing came 
        close to when he gave me my promise ring that night. 
        <h4>Spend Lots Of Time Together</h4>
        All throughout our third and fourth year, we became busier than 
        ever… it was hard seeing each other for an extended amount of time.
         It could’ve been from just 15 minutes to a little over an hour a 
         day, but we spent that time together as if it were our last.
         <h4>The Big Night!</h4>
         After we both finally got our degrees, we moved in with each other 
        not long after. A half a year later, he randomly asks to go out for 
        dinner at this fancy restaurant, I thought nothing of it at the 
        time other than it was a nice place that made remarkably good food.
        It was only until later in the evening, when the plates were being
        cleaned and most of the venue was empty, when I saw him get down 
        on one knee and said those 3 magical words.
        <h4>I Said YEEESSS!!</h4>
        The day after he proposed, I couldn’t hold my excitement, I had to 
        tell everyone about my lovely evening, and he had asked. I had let 
        all the people closest to me know that I had said yes milliseconds 
        after he had asked.My heart raced every time I had to tell the 
        story to different people.
        <h4>Planning Our Dream Wedding</h4>
        Now we are planning what seems to be the best day of our lives and
         we are even happier than ever, I can’t wait to start this amazing 
         life journey with the person I love so whole heartedly.
