      <h4>1. We Met At School</h4><hr>
      <p>
        In 2016, I was 16 years old, had just<br> finished 
        10th gradea few days prior to<br> the graduation 
        event that was being held<br> on the school grounds. 
        That night was by<br> far the best night of my life, 
        cause that's<br> when I saw the man of my dreams waiting<br> 
        in the doorway to the hall. Already drenched<br> in punch 
        and frantically cleaning himself off,<br> I knew from 
        the that point he would be the one.

      <h4>2. We Went To Univeristy Together</h4><hr>
      <p>
        A few years pass, after we both graduated<br> high school 
        together, we both immediately<br> began enrolling in 
        universities we both<br> found suitable. Fortunately for the 
        both of us<br> we got into the same university, but two<br> 
        completely different fields… obviously. I<br> went into 
        Databases, and he went into<br> Electrical Engineering.

      <h4>3. Date At The Lake</h4><hr>
      <p>
        Our first trip together was by far the best <br>we’ve had. 
        It was the time we both decided<br> to go to a log cabin near 
        a freshwater lake<br> up in the mountains after our first year 
        of <br>university. Things got exciting once we were<br> out the car,
        we ran and jumped alongside <br>the lake side all while the
        sunset between<br> the hills in the distance began to set.

     <h4>4. Morning Coffee's</h4><hr>
     <p>
      Once a week between all the assignments<br> and projects, we 
      would always take one<br> day out of our schedules and go for 
      either<br> morning or afternoon coffees. We used this<br> time to 
      catch up with each other, and it made<br> us grow more founder 
      for one another.

      <h4>5. Late Night Dinners</h4><hr>
      <p>
        Having dinner together was very rare in<br> our case, because 
        we would both either<br> be busy at the same time, or the one 
        is<br> busy while the other wasn’t. Though<br> when we did have the 
        opportunity to dine<br> together, it was late into the night but
         THAT<br> made it all the more special.

      <h4>6. Traveled To Germany</h4><hr>
      <p>
        For our second-year graduation celebration,<br> we somehow made the 
        money throughout<br> the year to go overseas. We both wanted<br> to go 
        somewhere different, he wanted to go<br> to the US and I wanted to go 
        to Italy, but we<br> put our differences aside and decided to<br> go to 
        his home town from when he was<br> a kid which was situated in 
        Germany, <br>Rothenburg.

      <h4>7. Christmas Festival on Vacation</h4><hr>
      <p>
        Luckily, we picked the most opportune<br> moment to go to Germany. We 
        had<br> arrived there the day before Christmas,<br> and we saw all the 
        towns folk setting up<br> for their annual Christmas Festival while<br> 
        walking the streets. However, it was<br> nothing compared to what we 
        saw on the<br> night of Christmas… all the colourful lights<br> lit up 
        the entire centre of the town where<br> they had set up massive 
        Christmas tree.<br> Out of all those amazing sights nothing <br>came 
        close to when he gave me my <br>promise ring that night.

      <h4>8. Spend Lots Of Time Together</h4><hr>
      <p>
        All throughout our third and fourth year,<br> we became busier than 
        ever… it was hard<br> seeing each other for an extended amount<br> of time.
         It could’ve been from just 15 minutes<br> to a little over an hour a 
         day, but we spent<br> that time together as if it were our last.

      <h4>9. The Big Night!</h4><hr>
      <p>
        After we both finally got our degrees,<br> we moved in with each other 
        not long<br> after. A half a year later, he randoml<br>y asks to go out for 
        dinner at this fancy<br> restaurant, I thought nothing of it at the<br> 
        time other than it was a nice place that<br> made remarkably good food.
        It was only<br> until later in the evening, when the plates<br> were being
        cleaned and most of the venue<br> was empty, when I saw him get down 
        on <br>one knee and said those 3 magical words.

      <h4>10. I Said YEEESSS!!</h4><hr>
      <p>
        The day after he proposed, I couldn’t<br> hold my excitement, I had to 
        tell<br> everyone about my lovely evening, and<br> he had asked. I had let 
        all the people<br> closest to me know that I had said yes<br> milliseconds 
        after he had asked. <br>My heart raced every time I had to tell <br>the 
        story to different people.
